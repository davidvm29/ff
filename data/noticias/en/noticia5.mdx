More than twenty-five years ago, [photographer Gervasio SÃ¡nchez](#) began documenting the effects of landmines on the population of places with war conflicts. It is a journalistic work that he has been developing for a quarter of a century, entering with empathy into the lives of its protagonists. The result is the book 'Mined Lives. 25 years', a work that was presented at the UCO and will be signed with an exhibition in 2025.
